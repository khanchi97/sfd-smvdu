```
<br>
`cd` into cloned repo:

Set the `upstream` to this repo:

The easiest way is to use the https url:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/smvdu/sfd-smvdu.git
```

or if you have ssh set up you can use that url instead:
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:smvdu/sfd-smvdu.git
```

<br>
Working branch for **sfd-smvdu** will always be the `develop` branch. Hence, all the latest code will always be on the *develop* branch.
You should always create a new branch for any new piece of work branching from *develop* branch:
```
git branch new_branch
```
**NOTE:** You must not mess with `master` branch or bad things will happen.
*master* branch contains the latest stable code, so just leave it be.

Before starting any new piece of work, move to *develop* branch:
```
git checkout develop
```
<br>
Now you can fetch latest changes from main repo using:
```
git fetch upstream
```
<br>
`merge` the latest code with *develop* branch:
```
git merge upstream/develop
```
<br>
`checkout` to your newly created branch:
```
git checkout new_branch
```
<br>
Rebase the code of *new_branch* from the code in *develop* branch, run the `rebase` command from your current branch:
```
git rebase develop
```
Now all your changes on your current branch will be based on the top of the changes in *develop* branch.

Push your changes to your forked repo
```
git push origin new_branch
```
<br>
Now, you can simply send the Pull Request to Parent Repo from within the Github.

Always squash up your commits into a single commit before sending the Pull Request. Use `git rebase -i` for this purpose. For example to squash last 3 commits into a single commit, simply run:
```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

####Happy Coding :)
